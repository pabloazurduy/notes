"What is the formula for the simple 2x2 Difference-in-Differences estimator?";"$\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{kU} = \bigg ( \overline{y}_k^{\text{post}(k)} - \overline{y}_k^{\text{pre}(k)} \bigg ) - \bigg ( \overline{y}_U^{\text{post}(k)} - \overline{y}_U^{\text{pre}(k)} \bigg )$";dd basic
"What is the parallel trends assumption in DD?";"The assumption that in absence of treatment, the difference between treatment and control groups would have remained constant over time. This is equivalent to saying the counterfactual trend would be parallel to the control group trend.";dd assumptions
"What are the three main methods to estimate standard errors in DD designs?";"1. Block bootstrapping standard errors<br>2. Aggregating data into pre/post periods (not recommended)<br>3. Clustering standard errors at group level";dd inference
"Why does clustering standard errors work better in DD?";"Clustering accounts for within-group correlation since observations within same group (e.g., state) are not independent. This leads to more accurate standard error estimates and reduces risk of overrejecting null hypothesis. In summary The issue here (when doing OLS directly on DnD, is that you have N· T data points, but they are not independent and identically distributed, since the same unit appears multiple times. In fact, the treatment is assigned to the unit, not to the time period, so you can argue that your sample size is actually just N, not N· T, even though this last one is what your regression will consider when computing standard errors. To correct the overly optimistic standard errors from your regression, you can cluster the standard errors by the unit (cities, in our example)";dd inference
"What is the Triple Differences (DDD) model and why use it?";"DDD introduces a third dimension (placebo group) to further isolate treatment effect by controlling for unobserved factors. If placebo group shows no changes, it strengthens argument that observed effects in treatment group are due to treatment itself.";dd advanced
"What is the main problem with Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) in staggered adoption?";"TWFE has two main issues:<br>1. Problematic weighting of individual 2x2 comparisons<br>2. Uses past treated units as controls for future treated units, which is problematic with heterogeneous treatment effects over time";dd advanced
"How can we validate the parallel trends assumption?";"Three main methods:<br>1. Visual inspection of raw data<br>2. Placebo tests<br>3. Leads and lags model to check pre-treatment trends";dd assumptions
"What is the Bacon decomposition and why is it useful?";"The Bacon decomposition helps decompose treatment effect into components based on timing of treatment. Particularly useful in DiD with staggered treatment adoption to understand how different timing groups contribute to overall treatment effect.";dd advanced
"What is the interpretation of the ATT in a DD design?";"The Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) represents the average causal effect of the treatment on those who received it, comparing their actual outcomes to what would have happened in absence of treatment.";dd basic
"What is the leads and lags model in DD?";"A model that includes pre-treatment (leads) and post-treatment (lags) indicators to: <br>1. Validate parallel trends assumption through pre-treatment coefficients<br>2. Examine dynamic treatment effects through post-treatment coefficients.";dd advanced
"What is the key difference between DD and DDD designs?";"DD compares changes in treatment vs control groups over time, while DDD adds a third comparison group (often a placebo) to further control for time-varying confounders that might affect treatment and control groups differently.";dd basic
"What are the main threats to the validity of a DD design?";"Main threats include:<br>1. Violation of parallel trends<br>2. Anticipatory effects<br>3. Concurrent policies or events<br>4. Compositional changes in groups<br>5. Serial correlation in outcomes";dd assumptions
"Why might standard errors be biased in DD designs?";"Standard errors can be biased due to:<br>1. Serial correlation in outcomes<br>2. Within-group correlation<br>3. Small number of groups<br>4. Long time series";dd inference
"What is the role of event studies in DD?";"Event studies in DD:<br>1. Test parallel trends assumption<br>2. Examine dynamic treatment effects<br>3. Detect anticipatory effects<br>4. Identify treatment effect persistence";dd advanced
"What is treatment effect heterogeneity in DD?";"Treatment effect heterogeneity occurs when the impact of treatment varies across:<br>1. Different groups<br>2. Different time periods<br>3. Different contexts<br>This can bias TWFE estimates in staggered adoption designs.";dd advanced
"What are the advantages of using regression in DD versus simple means?";"Regression in DD allows:<br>1. Control for time-varying covariates<br>2. Improve precision of estimates<br>3. Test multiple hypotheses<br>4. Handle multiple treatment periods<br>5. Account for individual fixed effects";dd basic
"How does selective migration affect DD estimates?";"Selective migration can bias DD estimates by:<br>1. Changing group composition over time<br>2. Creating endogenous treatment status<br>3. Violating stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)<br>4. Contaminating control groups";dd assumptions
