"What is Sharp RDD?";"A design where treatment status changes deterministically from 0 to 1 at a specific cutoff value of the running variable";rdd basic
"What is Fuzzy RDD?";"A design where the probability of treatment changes at the cutoff but not deterministically (treatment assignment is not perfect)";rdd basic
"What is the main identifying assumption in RDD?";"The continuity assumption: potential outcomes are continuous functions of the running variable at the cutoff";rdd assumptions
"What does LATE mean in RDD context?";"Local Average Treatment Effect - the average causal effect for units near the cutoff point";rdd basic
"Why do we need to check for manipulation in RDD?";"To ensure that units cannot precisely manipulate their position around the cutoff, which would violate the continuity assumption";rdd assumptions
"What is the McCrary test used for in RDD?";"To test for manipulation by checking if there's a discontinuity in the density of the running variable at the cutoff";rdd inference
"What are common bandwidth selection methods in RDD?";"1. Cross-validation<br>2. Optimal bandwidth calculations<br>3. Multiple bandwidth sensitivity analysis";rdd advanced
"Why might we recenter the running variable in RDD?";"To make interpretation easier by having the cutoff at zero and to improve numerical stability in estimation";rdd basic
"What is the role of polynomial terms in RDD?";"To control for nonlinear relationships between the running variable and outcome, though high-order polynomials are discouraged";rdd intermediate
"What is the specification assumption in RDD?";"The assumption about the functional form of the relationship between the running variable and outcome (e.g., linear, quadratic)";rdd assumptions
"What are typical placebo tests in RDD?";"1. Testing for discontinuities at non-cutoff points<br>2. Testing for balance in pre-treatment covariates<br>3. Testing for discontinuities in outcomes that shouldn't be affected";rdd inference
"How is a fuzzy RDD similar to instrumental variables?";"The cutoff serves as an instrument for treatment, and estimation often uses 2SLS similar to IV designs";rdd advanced
"What is the 'bandwidth' in RDD?";"The window of observations around the cutoff used for estimation - wider bandwidths increase precision but may introduce bias";rdd basic
"Why do we need the single treatment assumption in RDD?";"To ensure that the only factor causing a discontinuous change at the cutoff is our treatment of interest";rdd assumptions
"What are common threats to RDD validity?";"1. Manipulation of running variable<br>2. Multiple treatments at cutoff<br>3. Anticipation effects<br>4. Non-random heaping<br>5. Endogenous cutoff selection";rdd intermediate
"How do we interpret RDD estimates?";"As causal effects for units near the cutoff (LATE), which may not generalize to units far from the cutoff";rdd basic
"What is the Wald estimator in fuzzy RDD?";"The ratio of the outcome discontinuity to the treatment probability discontinuity at the cutoff";rdd advanced
"Why do we need covariate balance tests in RDD?";"To check if there are discontinuities in pre-treatment variables, which would violate the continuity assumption";rdd inference
"What is the boundary bias problem in RDD?";"The tendency for kernel regression to be biased at the boundary (cutoff) due to asymmetric data availability";rdd advanced
"When is fuzzy RDD preferred over sharp RDD?";"When treatment assignment is not perfectly determined by the running variable but shows a discontinuous change in probability";rdd intermediate
"What assumptions are needed for fuzzy RDD?";"1. Continuity assumption<br>2. Exclusion restriction<br>3. Monotonicity<br>4. SUTVA<br>5. Strong first stage";rdd assumptions
"How can we test the continuity assumption?";"1. Visual inspection of the running variable<br>2. Testing for covariate balance<br>3. Density tests<br>4. Placebo outcomes";rdd inference
"What is the role of local linear regression in RDD?";"To reduce bias at the boundary by fitting separate linear functions on each side of the cutoff";rdd advanced
"What makes a good running variable in RDD?";"1. Precise measurement<br>2. No manipulation possibility<br>3. Clear cutoff point<br>4. Continuous distribution";rdd basic
"Why should we avoid high-order polynomials in RDD?";"They can lead to noisy estimates and poor inference, as shown by Gelman and Imbens (2019)";rdd intermediate
