# 10 Dynamic Regression Models
In this chapter, we consider how to extend ARIMA models in order to allow other information to be included in the models (exogenous variables). We considered regression models of the form:

$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,t} + \dots + \beta_k x_{k,t} + \varepsilon_t,
$$

In this chapter, we will allow the errors from a regression to contain autocorrelation. (given that we will contain autogregression parameters)

Minimising the sum of squared  $Îµ_t$ values avoids these problems. Alternatively, maximum likelihood estimation can be used; this will give similar estimates of the coefficients.
