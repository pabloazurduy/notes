### 2.2 Extreme Points Vertices and basic feasible solutions 

Def. Let $P$ be a polyendron. A vector $x$ is an extreme point of $P$ if it cannot be expressed as a convex combination of two other distinct vector in P. let be $y, z \in P$ distinct vectors, then $x$ is an extreme point of $P$ if there are no $\lambda \in [0,1]$ such that $x = \lambda y + (1-\lambda) z$.
