## Algorithms For Decision Making -  Chapter 7 

before some notation:
1. An **Action variable**  will be denoted by a square node 
2. A **Chance variable** will be denoted by a circle node 
3. A **Utility variable** will be denoted by a diamond node 

In the image the T is a decision node (square) the Disease it's a random variable that it's independent (no upper dependency), the $O_i$ nodes are the test results that depend on the Disease, and the $U$ node will represent the utility, that depends on the Treatment and the Disease $D$.
