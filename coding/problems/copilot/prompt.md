# Data science interview exercises

I need to study some coding python exercises for a data science interview, probably the questions will contain some data manipulation, statistics and machine learning. Can you give me some coding exercises to practice?

Write the exercise prompt on a file called exercises_{{num}}.md and add a test case for that function there should be an exercise_{{num}}.py which will contain the structure for the function and solution and an exercise_{{num}}_test.py which will run exercise_{{num}}.py and test the function with the test case provided in exercises_{{num}}.md 

Add a flag on how hard is the exercise (easy, medium, hard, very hard) and a time correlation, easy should take {{num}}
5 minutes, medium 30 minutes and hard 60 minutes

create a subfolder called coding/exercises/{{num}} and inside that folder create the following files:
with difficulty {{difficulty}} and estimated time {{time}} minutes
    - exercise_{{num}}.md
    - exercise_{{num}}.py
    - exercise_{{num}}_test.py
